## Resources
- Datasets:
  - [data.js](https://github.com/gforce2332/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

- Software:
  - JavaScript
  - D3 Library
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Results
Created a webpage and dynamic table to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition 
to the date, users can apply table filters for the city, state, country, and shape creating an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO 
sightings.

## Summary
This custom webpage displays UFO sightings that have been reported around the world. A user can search for UFO sightings by filtering on date, city, state, country, and/or shape and will display results according to user input. The images displayed above show results with no filters vs a filter on the State of Oregon displaying  3 results. Clicking on the "UFO Sightings" navigation bar in the top left corner of the page will reset the table by clearing all filters.

## Recommendations
- One drawback to the new design is too many filters may result in returning zero sightings. Adding a drop down menu to each filter allowing the user to select possible choices would eliminate this. 
- Any new user to this sight would not necessarily be aware that clicking the upper left corner will clear the filter. Creating a "Clear" button to clear results inplace of clicking UFO Sightings in the navigation bar would be an enhancement in further development.
